# SCAFFOLDING

### Working directories
>In order to run successfully the project, you **HAVE TO** set the right working directories.
> 
>All the paths in this guide are **realatives** and will start from the root of the repository downloaded 
> from GitHub (the default name is Chat).  
> In the CLion IDE you will be asking to specify an **absolute path**, so please pay attention to what you are doing.
> 
> **If you do not find some of the executables written below, please build the project first and then set the right working directories.**  
> 
> You are supposed to set two different path:  
> 1. The PalanoChatUtenti executable needs to work inside the root of the repository (Chat), so the path is : `./` **(remember that this is a relative path)**
>    
> 
> 2. The runUnitTests executable needs to work inside the following path: `test/testingFixtureDir` **(remember that this is a relative path)**
